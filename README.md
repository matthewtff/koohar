koohar
======

Library to process http requests.

Building.

First of all make sure you've got installed boost on your system.

Linux:

To build library execute "CXX=clang++ cmake .". It would bring you a static
library (clang++ 3.1 or higher is required).

Windows:

Koohar uses some c++11 stuff, so make sure you have Visual Studio 10 or higher.
Just use cmake to build project(solution) and build it.
